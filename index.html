            <h4>Objectives</h4>
              <p> In my career so far I've worked as a non-profit program coordinator, a teacher to adult learners and a journalist. My skills are in program mamagement (recruiting and managing volunteers, short and long-term planning, etc.), teaching adults learners in the areas of ESL and personal finance and communications skills related to print journalism (writing, editing and page layout). In the next phase of my career, I hope to marry all these skills as a web developer. Mainly, I will employ and further develop skills in problem solving, editing and translating technical information. Additionally, I hope to use skills as a manager, facilitator, planner, designer and teacher.
              </p>
