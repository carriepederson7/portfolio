        <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
        <!-- current interests hobbies and skills -->
        <div class="aboutme">
          <p> My goal as a software developer is to create high-quality products that are widely understood. I want to
            help others to better control and organize data. Through this work, I want to build relationships in the
            digital and non-digital world that lead to new possibilities.

            For the last 10 years, I've been working in non-profits in a coordinator role as a planner, administrator
            and teacher. The signature of my work has been competency, consistency and quality. With these principles in
            mind, I look forward to working as part of a team to continue to grow products and programs.
